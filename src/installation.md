# Installation

Paperback is a modern, ad-free reading app for Apple devices that supports manga,
comics, novels, and more. It delivers a smooth, distraction-free experience with
features such as offline reading, iCloud sync, and progress tracking.

::: warning Apple Device Required
Paperback is an app for Apple devices only, for Android and Windows we recommend
[Mihon](https://mihon.app/) and [Suwayomi](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server)
respectively.
:::

By default, Paperback comes with no built-in content. To read anything, you will
need to install extensions that connect to reading sources.

Inkdex is a community-driven project that develops and maintains these extensions.
