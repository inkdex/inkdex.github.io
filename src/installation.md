# Installation

Paperback is a modern, ad-free reading app for Apple devices. It offers a smooth, distraction-free experience with features like offline reading, iCloud sync, and progress tracking.

By default, Paperback comes with no built-in content. To read anything, you’ll need to install extensions that connect to reading sources.

::: warning Apple Device Required
Paperback is an app for Apple devices only, for Android and Windows we recommend [Mihon](https://mihon.app/) and [Suwayomi](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server) respectively.
