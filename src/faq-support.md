### Is there an extension for x site
<details>
<summary>v0.8</summary>
Discord has a search function. Please use it.

To search for an extension you want to search in the relevant repo channel, eg #repos-v08

For example in the discord search field place -

<kbd>in: #repos-v08 mangadex</kbd>

Note that extension names don't have spaces, so for Asura Scans for example it is listed as AsuraScan

### How do I filter other scans out on Aggregate sites (eg ComicK, MangaDex)?
> [!NOTE]
>Some titles may have several scanlation groups translating them as well as an official version. Certain sites make all these available, leading there to be multiple versions of the same chapter. For example Chapter 1 may have an Official version, an asurascans version and a Flame Scans version.

<details>
<summary>v0.8</summary>
<ul>
  <li>In the individual title (eg Solo Leveling), open it so the chapter list is displaying</li>
  <li>Tap on the <i>ellipsis (...)</i> </li>
  <li>Select <i>Group Priority</i></li>
  <li>Here you can sort the priority of the scan groups by dragging on the hamburger (the three horizontal slashes). For example you could Official first followed by Flame Scans etc.</li>
</ul>
If you enable the setting <b>Hide Other Groups</b> it will only display the top group. It will display another group only if the first group does not have a chapter available. May need to exit out of the title & go back into it for the chapters to refresh.

<summary>v0.9</summary>
<ul>
  <li>In the individual title (eg Solo Leveling), open it so the chapter list is displaying</li>
  <li>Tap on the <i>ellipsis (...)</i> </li>
  <li>Select <i>Manage Version Priority</i></li>

	<li>A popup titled <b>Title Settings</b> will open</li>
  </ul>	
  <li>In the section titled <b>AVAILABLE VERSIONS</b> tap one or more listings, which will move them up to the <b>PRIORITISED VERSIONS</b></li>
  <li>If you have more than one listing in <b>PRIORITISED VERSIONS</b>, hold press on the hamburger and drag to reorder, with highest priority first, second priority second etc</li>
</ul>

If you enable the setting <b>Hide Other Versions</b> it will only display those listed in <b>PRIORITISED VERSIONS</b>. It will display another group only if those in <b>PRIORITISED VERSIONS</b> do not have a chapter available. May need to exit out of the title & go back into it for the chapters to refresh.

### MangaBox themed sites (eg Manganato, Mangakakalot, MangaBat) have gaps or splits on the displayed pages

- The site owners switched from paged chapters to now just long strips and because of this they are now cropping images in random sizes.
- The only available fix currently is just to read chapters Vertically with no page padding.
- Reading horizontal manga horizontally will not work properly for these sites. It is not something that can be resolved at an extension level.
