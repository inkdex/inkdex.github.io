### Are there any Western Comic extensions?

<details>
<summary>v0.8</summary>
Currently there are two - ReadAllComics and ReadComicsOnline. Both found in Netsky's Extensions (0.8)
(The site for ReadAllComics is down currently. According to X (Twitter), they are working at restoring the site, no eta.)
</details>
<details>
<summary>v0.9</summary>
Batcave<br>
Found here - https://karrot0.github.io/KakarotExtension/0.9/stable/
</details>

### Is there an extension for x site
<details>
<summary>v0.8</summary>
Discord has a search function. Please use it.

To search for an extension you want to search in the relevant repo channel, eg #repos-v08

For example in the discord search field place -

<kbd>in: #repos-v08 mangadex</kbd>

Note that extension names don't have spaces, so for Asura Scans for example it is listed as AsuraScan

### How do I filter other scans out on Aggregate sites (eg ComicK, MangaDex)?
> [!NOTE]
>Some titles may have several scanlation groups translating them as well as an official version. Certain sites make all these available, leading there to be multiple versions of the same chapter. For example Chapter 1 may have an Official version, an asurascans version and a Flame Scans version.

<details>
<summary>v0.8</summary>
<ul>
  <li>In the individual title (eg Solo Leveling), open it so the chapter list is displaying</li>
  <li>Tap on the <i>ellipsis (...)</i> </li>
  <li>Select <i>Group Priority</i></li>
  <li>Here you can sort the priority of the scan groups by dragging on the hamburger (the three horizontal slashes). For example you could Official first followed by Flame Scans etc.</li>
</ul>
If you enable the setting <b>Hide Other Groups</b> it will only display the top group. It will display another group only if the first group does not have a chapter available. May need to exit out of the title & go back into it for the chapters to refresh.

<summary>v0.9</summary>
<ul>
  <li>In the individual title (eg Solo Leveling), open it so the chapter list is displaying</li>
  <li>Tap on the <i>ellipsis (...)</i> </li>
  <li>Select <i>Manage Version Priority</i></li>
  <ul> 	
	<li>A popup titled <b>Title Settings</b> will open</li>
  </ul>	
  <li>In the section titled <b>AVAILABLE VERSIONS</b> tap one or more listings, which will move them up to the <b>PRIORITISED VERSIONS</b></li>
  <li>If you have more than one listing in <b>PRIORITISED VERSIONS</b>, hold press on the hamburger and drag to reorder, with highest priority first, second priority second etc</li>
</ul>

If you enable the setting <b>Hide Other Versions</b> it will only display those listed in <b>PRIORITISED VERSIONS</b>. It will display another group only if those in <b>PRIORITISED VERSIONS</b> do not have a chapter available. May need to exit out of the title & go back into it for the chapters to refresh.

### Are external repos/sources safe?

All sources and repos here are safe to use and their code is open source, meaning you can check what they do and how they work on GitHub.

All the sources/repos posted on InkDex have to be open source!  
In general sources cannot do any harm to your device, if you're doubtful about a certain source, don't use it. Or check it's code on it's respective GitHub repository.

### What are the best source(s) to install? / What source has x manga?

Please don't ask this question, It's highly subjective.  
Just look around on the internet for your manga, see if that site is a source, install that source.

If the source does not exist, you can request it in ⁠requests-v08, no guarantee it'll be made.

Be independent and do some research yourself.

### Is there any copyrighted material hosted?

Yes and no. We ourselves do not host anything!

Sources are just scripts to pull information from sites that do host these items. Sources themselves do not have any copyrighted material, the websites they access may do.

This site & the discord server are in no way affiliated with any of those websites, the discord server serves as a central point to get these "scripts" aka sources.

### Why has my request for a source not been added yet?

Source requests are never certain to be added or created.

The channel is there for a source developer to see which source the community wants. It's purely an indication for source developers.

If you want your source to be added, the best chance you have is:
- Do it yourself.
- Know someone who knows web scraping and JS/TS, ask them to do it.
- Request a site/source that is original, not a generic manga/manhua site.
  
*Most manga/manhwa or alike are already available on other sources, making a whole source just because you don't want to wait 1 hour for another site to pick it up is not worth it for most developers.

Since we have only a few source developers and most of them are English, foreign sources are unlikely to be added.

### MangaBox themed sites (eg Manganato, Mangakakalot, MangaBat) have gaps or splits on the displayed pages

- The site owners switched from paged chapters to now just long strips and because of this they are now cropping images in random sizes.
- The only available fix currently is just to read chapters Vertically with no page padding.
- Reading horizontal manga horizontally will not work properly for these sites. It is not something that can be resolved at an extension level.
