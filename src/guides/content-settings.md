# Content Settings

Content Settings when on will cause the cover of titles to be blurred and have a letter on them.  

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/V0.9 Content Settings - blurred with U M.png" alt="Blurred Covers" width="300"></p>


There are three letters that may appear
- A for Adult
- M for Mature
- U for Unknown

To gain access to the Content Settings in Paperback, first you need to enable them on your device.

`Device settings > Apps > Paperback > Enable Content Settings`  

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/V0.9 Content Settings - Device Apps.png" alt="Device Apps" width="300"height="100">  <img src="Images/V0.9 Content Settings - Enable Content Settings.png" alt="Paperback Apps Settings" width="300"height="100"></p>

Once enabled, two new sections for content settings will now appear in Paperback's General Settings - LIBRARY CONTENT SETTINGS and SEARCH CONTENT SETTINGS.
