# Content Settings

Content Settings will cause the cover of titles to be blurred and have a
letter on them.

<div align= "center">
  <img src="/v0.9/content-settings-blurred-with-u-m.avif" alt="Blurred Covers" width="300" />
</div>

There are three letters that may appear

- A for Adult
- M for Mature
- U for Unknown

To gain access to the Content Settings in Paperback, first you need to enable them
on your device. There are different ways to do based on your device type:

- iOS/iPadOS
  - Go to the **Settings** app.
  - Tap **_Apps_** → **_Paperback_**.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/v0.9/content-settings-device-apps.avif" alt="Device Apps" width="300" height="100" hspace="10" /> <img src="/v0.9/content-settings-enable-content-settings.avif" alt="Paperback App Settings" width="300" height="100" hspace="10" />
</div>

- macOS
  - Go to your menu bar.
  - Select **_Paperback_** → **_Settings_** → **_General_**.

<!-- TODO: Add images -->

- Enable the **_Content Settings_** setting.

Once enabled, two new sections for content settings will now appear in the Paperback
app its **General Settings**:

- **LIBRARY CONTENT SETTINGS**
- **SEARCH CONTENT SETTINGS**

These allow you to disable the blur on covers as well as to force hide titles instead.
