# Content Settings

Content Settings will cause the cover of titles to be blurred and have a letter
on them.

<div align= "center">
  <img src="/v0.9/content-settings-blurred-with-u-m.avif" alt="Blurred Covers" width="300" />
</div>

## Rating Indicators

There are three letters that may appear on the blurred covers:

- **A** for Adult
- **M** for Mature
- **U** for Unknown

## Enabling Content Settings

To gain access to the Content Settings in Paperback, first you need to enable them
on your device system settings.

### iOS/iPadOS

1. Go to the **Settings** app.
2. Tap **_Apps_** → **_Paperback_**.
3. Toggle on the **_Content Settings_** setting.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/v0.9/content-settings-device-apps.avif" alt="Device Apps" width="300" height="100" hspace="10" /> <img src="/v0.9/content-settings-enable-content-settings.avif" alt="Paperback App Settings" width="300" height="100" hspace="10" />
</div>

### macOS

1. In the menu bar at the top of the screen.
2. Select **_Paperback_** → **_Settings_** → **_General_**.
3. Enable the **_Content Settings_** setting.

## App Configuration

Once enabled on your device, two new sections for content settings will appear in
the Paperback app.

1. Tap the _cog icon_ → **_General Settings_**.
2. Locate the new sections:
   - **Library Content Settings**
   - **Search Content Settings**

These allow you to disable the blur on covers as well as to force hide titles instead.
