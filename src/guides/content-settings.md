# Content Settings

Content Settings when on will cause the cover of titles to be blurred and have a letter on them.

<p align= "center"><img src="/v0.9/content-settings-blurred-with-u-m.avif" alt="Blurred Covers" width="300"></p>

There are three letters that may appear

- A for Adult
- M for Mature
- U for Unknown

To gain access to the Content Settings in Paperback, first you need to enable them on your device.

`Device settings > Apps > Paperback > Enable Content Settings`

<p align= "center"><img src="/v0.9/content-settings-device-apps.avif" alt="Device Apps" width="300"height="100" hspace="10">  <img src="/v0.9/content-settings-enable-content-settings.avif" alt="Paperback Apps Settings" width="300"height="100" hspace="10"></p>

Once enabled, two new sections for content settings will now appear in Paperback's General Settings - LIBRARY CONTENT SETTINGS and SEARCH CONTENT SETTINGS.

<p align= "center"><img src="/v0.9/content-settings-content-settings-in-paperback.avif" alt="Content Settings in Paperback" width="300"></p>

> [!TIP]
> Some extensions have their own Content Settings as well. See the [FAQ](../faq.md)
